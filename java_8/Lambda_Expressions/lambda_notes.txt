## Lambda Expression — Quick Notes (Java)

### 1) What is a Lambda Expression?

A **Lambda Expression** is a short way to implement a method of a **functional interface** (an interface having only one abstract method).

It helps reduce boilerplate code, especially when using anonymous classes.

---

### 2) Why Lambda was introduced?

Before lambda, we needed anonymous classes to implement interfaces, which required more code.

Lambda expressions:

* Reduce code length
* Improve readability
* Make functional-style programming easier
* Are widely used with collections and streams

---

### 3) Basic Syntax

```java
(parameters) -> { method body }
```

Examples:

**Single parameter**

```java
x -> x * x
```

**Multiple parameters**

```java
(a, b) -> a + b
```

**With method body**

```java
(a, b) -> {
    int sum = a + b;
    return sum;
}
```

---

### 4) Functional Interface

A functional interface has **only one abstract method**.

Example:

```java
interface Calculator {
    int add(int a, int b);
}
```

Lambda implementation:

```java
Calculator c = (a, b) -> a + b;
System.out.println(c.add(5, 3));
```

---

### 5) Lambda vs Anonymous Class

Before:

```java
Calculator c = new Calculator() {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
};
```

Using Lambda:

```java
Calculator c = (a, b) -> a + b;
```

Cleaner and shorter.

### 6) Common Use Cases

Lambda is mostly used with:

* Collections sorting
* Streams API
* Runnable threads
* Event handling

Example sorting:

```java
list.sort((a, b) -> a - b);
```

---

### 7) Important Rules

✅ Interface must have one abstract method
✅ Parameters type can be omitted
✅ Curly braces optional for single statement
✅ `return` optional if single expression

---

### 8) When NOT to use Lambda

Avoid lambda if:

* Logic is very large
* Code becomes hard to read

---

### One-Line Interview Definition

**Lambda expression is a concise way to represent an implementation of a functional interface in Java.**
